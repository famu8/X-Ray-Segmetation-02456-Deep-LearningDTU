# X-Ray-Segmetation-02456-Deep-LearningDTU
This project proposes using deep neural networks to automate PXCT image segmentation, eliminating the need for human intervention, by comparing two distinct neural network models, more specifically a U-Net and a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN), Pix2Pix
